<h1> JobPost Web API</h3>
<h3>About this</h3>
<p>This is one half of a bigger "hobby"-project created mainly to showcase my ability as a fullstack developer. </p>
<p> The goal is to create a job finding website of some sort, although I have not decided how far I want to go or how advanced it will be (for this type of project anyways ðŸ˜…). </p>

<h3>Information and tech stack</h3>
<p>This is an **ASP.NET Core REST Api** connected to a **MySQLServer** database. The database and the tables were created through a code first approach, by first creating entities and defining their properties as classes and creating a migration. I created a SQL-Server through the **Azure Portal** and setup the connection strings so I could run the migration an create the database. When the database was created I created an **Web/App Service** project in the **Azure Portal** to deploy the project and host the REST api on Azure as well. While deploying I configured a simple **CD-pipeline** through a **yaml file** with **Github Actions**.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
