<h2> JobPost Web API</h3>
<h3>About this</h3>
<p>This is one half of a bigger "hobby"-project created mainly to showcase my ability as a fullstack developer. </p>
<p> The goal is to create a job finding website of some sort, although I have not decided how far I want to go or how advanced it will be (for this type of project anyways ðŸ˜…). </p>
<p> The plan is, however, to keep an use case document, describing the projects different capabilities aswell, as shared plans of future functionality. </p>
